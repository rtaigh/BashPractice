Here are some bash scripts I've generated. Most are just deplaying an understanding of bash scripting.
Others hold a functional purpose, after writing out the shebang and chmod +x three times, I created newbash.sh
to automate shell generation.
I've also created bashCnt.sh which counts the the number of executables in the the directory.
